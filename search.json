The output of your project is a reproducible workflow following methods introduced in Applied Geodata Science I and a short presentation.\nIf you haven’t followed the course Applied Geodata Science I, it is encouraged that you familiarise yourself with essential contents taught therein and partner up with a colleague who has followed the course. See Section 2.1 for a list of most important chapters for self-study.\nChose your own project content, get inspired by what you’ve learned in your Geography studies, and discover patterns with your own data analysis. The only requirement is that your project relates to research and data with a relation to Geography and related disciplines. You can develop you own project idea, or use our suggestions here as a starting point. Groups that decide to work on those will be able to start implementing the project earlier, therefore will also have earlier presentation dates.\nYou should review the code from a group other than your own, try to run their code and provide them with feedback on the implementation and the project content itself. At the same time, you will receive feedback from another group, that you should implement in your own project.\nActive participation in the presentation sessions is expected, posing questions and providing feedback for a group’s presentation."

A list of useful data sources is provided as a starting point in Chapter 4.\nWork with the data, visualise patterns, and analyse relationships, differences, trends, etc.\nDocument the whole processing and analysis of the data, from data download to result interpretations.\nOrganize your code and data into a repository (with git), such that other students can easily reproduce it. You will actually run each other’s code, so make it understandable.\nAs the grand finale, present your work with slides. Each group will have 10 min. for their presentation, followed by 5 min for questions."

Effective and clear communication of results is achieved when general principles of scientific writing are followed and the report is organised along the following line:\n\nIntroduction: Gives the background, explains the relevance, and motivates the (research) question. The introduction may also motivate the methodological approach, but doesn’t give its details.\nMethods and Data: Describes the data (scale, source, etc.) and the methods.\nResults: Reports the results in a logical order that facilitates reading - from the general pattern to the details. Basic and central finding first, then the nuance.\nDiscussion: Explain what the results mean in relation to the question stated in the Introduction. Discuss caveats, compare to earlier findings, and explain the relevance of your results.\n\nThe report for this class (Proseminar) is not supposed to be publishable science. It doesn’t have to be novel. The focus is to tell a story with data. Therefore, you may implement the structure described above with some freedom. Make your report appealing, clear, and transparent."

Each pair of students will create a project and submit a GitHub repository, following the AGDS example project, containing all code and a RMarkdown file as report. At the end of the semester, each pair will present their project to the rest of the class and exchange feedback.\n\nStudents hand in their work in the form of a link, sent to Prof. B. Stocker, to a git repository that contains a project proposal (README.md) and code for a reproducible workflow (vignettes/report.Rmd). Furthermore, students will present their project in class.\nThe contribution of each component to your grade is as follows:\n\nPresentation (30%). Your presentation should introduce and motivate your question, explain how you used data to answer it, and discuss the results of your analysis and modelling. Make sure that your slides are nicely formatted, clear and informative, and that both people in the team speak.\nReport (70%).\n\nFor grading the report, we consider the following criteria:\n\nReproducibility (25%). Make sure your RMarkdown code is reproducible and generates a html document as intended. You can check this by letting a colleague clone your git repository and run your code on their machine. If it fails, it’s not reproducible, and you won’t get points for this aspect. To aid reproducibility, add text to your report that provides essential information and explanations of workflow steps, including data download, processing and analysis.\nWorkspace organisation and code (25%). Follow the principles for workspace organisation and coding as described in the AGDS book (here and here).\nPresentation (25%). This considers the appearance of the generated html document, its text (with proper citations, see Chapter 5) and figures. Provide context, create at least three good data visualizations, and discuss your findings.\nAnalysis and modelling (25%). This considers the correctness of analysis and modelling implementations, and the reasonable application of methods.\n\nEach pair of students will hand in a single report.\nCode duplications are not permitted and affected code will be graded with zero points for the respective part of the report.\nReports cannot be re-submitted after having received the grades. Make sure all is reproducible before you submit.\n\n\n1.7.1 Note of caution\nThe use of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, for supporting code development should be considered with caution and is not permitted for writing report text. We are aware that LLMs can help solving technical tasks and the right use of LLMs for solving your problem is not discouraged. However, be aware that code produced by LLMs is not tested to be functional and error-free. Therefore, you have to understand what you get and verify and correct code with a view to your problem. Note that LLMs use text from various sources on the internet. Your report text must not contain verbatim copied text from unidentified sources. This would be considered plagiarism."

Site latitude ranged from 42°48’ S to 71°16’ N and mean annual growing season temperature ranged from 3 to 30°C.\nThe dataset contains raw photosynthetic CO2 response curves (ACi curves) measured at different leaf temperature temperatures, and estimated parameters (Vcmax, Jmax and TPU) and their temperature response parameters. It includes data from different types of experiments (e.g. temperature warming experiments, CO2 enrichment experiments, drought experiments) allowing examination of parameter responses to environmental drivers.\nFile information:\n\nACi-TGlob_V1.0.csv\nThe dataset containing individual ACi curves.

They are derived from a combination of Earth observation data, depending on the year, from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat’s ASAR instrument and JAXA’s Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional information from Earth observation sources. The data has been produced as part of the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme by the Biomass CCI team. This release of the data is version 3. Compared to version 2, this is a consolidated version of the Above Ground Biomass (AGB) maps. This version also includes a preliminary estimate of AGB changes for two epochs. The data products consist of two\n\nglobal layers that include estimates of: 1) above ground biomass (AGB, unit: tons/ha i.e., Mg/ha) (raster dataset). This is defined as the mass, expressed as oven-dry weight of the woody parts (stem, bark, branches and twigs) of all living trees excluding stump and roots 2) per-pixel estimates of above-ground biomass uncertainty expressed as the standard deviation in Mg/ha (raster dataset). In addition, files describing the AGB change between 2018 and the other two years are provided (labelled as 2018_2010 and 2018_2017). These consist of two sets of maps: the standard deviation of the AGB change and a quality flag of the AGB change. Note that the change itself can be simply computed as the difference between two AGB maps, so is not provided directly. Data are provided in both netcdf and geotiff format.\n\n\n\n\n\nSantoro, M.; Cartus, O.

The four PFTs, needleaf evergreen (NEEV), needleleaf deciduous (NEDE), broadleaf evergreen (BREV) and broadleaf deciduous (BRDC) are mapped from the MODIS Collection 5.1 land cover dataset, crosswalking land cover types to PFT fractions. The source of data for the age distributions is from country-level forest inventory for temperate and high-latitude countries, and from biomass for tropical countries. The inventory and biomass data are related to fifteen age classes defined in ten-year intervals, from 1-10 up to a class greater than 150 years old. The GFAD dataset represents the 2000-2010 era.\nVariables:\n\nlon, lat (720*360)\n4 PFTs\n15 age classes\n\nRemained issues: Some area was still in blank (e.g. South Australia, Southwest Asia) which needs further interpolation.

The dataset consists of two separate products based each on a different SIF retrieval, either JJ (Joiner et al. 2013) or PK (Köhler et al. 2015). The temporal coverage of the dataset is 2007 to 2018. The temporal sampling of the product is 8 days, but every record is based on SIF input data retrieved over a 16-day moving window. The day reported in the NetCDF file corresponds to the 9th day of the 16-day retrieval period.\n\n\n\n\nDuveiller, G., Filipponi, F., Walther, S., Köhler, P., Frankenberg, C., Guanter, L., and Cescatti, A.: A spatially downscaled sun-induced fluorescence global product for enhanced monitoring of vegetation productivity, Earth Syst.

Our SIF estimates are highly correlated with GPP from 91 FLUXNET sites (R2 = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001). Compared with the coarse-resolution SIF data that are directly aggregated from OCO-2 soundings, GOSIF has finer spatial resolution, globally continuous coverage, and a much longer record. GOSIF is useful for assessing terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem function and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models. The methodology, validation, and spatial and temporal patterns of this product are described in the paper (Li and Xiao, 2019).\nOCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF) was produced by a data-driven approach which established multivariate linear regression models between SIF from discrete OCO-2 soundings and a set of explanatory variables including EVI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and meteorological variables (photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit or VPD) from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) (Li and Xiao, 2019a).\nMore information: http://data.globalecology.unh.edu/data/GOSIF_v2/8day/Data_Use_Policy_and_Readme_GOSIF_v2.pdf\n\n\n\n\nLi, X., Xiao, J.

In-situ streamflow observations from the GSIM dataset are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) meteorological forcing dataset. The data are provided in NetCDFv4 format at monthly resolution covering the period 1902-2014.\nThe GRUN reconstruction (“GRUN_v1_GSWP3_WGS84_05_1902_2014.nc” file) is provided on a 0.5 degrees (WGS84) grid in units of mm/day. The runoff time series correspond to the ensemble mean of 50 reconstructions obtained by training the machine learning model with different subsets of data. The individual ensemble members of the reconstruction are provided in the “Realizations_GRUN_v1_GSWP3_WGS84_05_1902_2014.zip” file.\n\n\n\n\nGhiggi, G., Humphrey, V., Seneviratne, S.

Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .\nThis Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey’s Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution. PLEASE NOTE: This dataset is a correction to a previous version which was found to contain errors (doi:10/t7d). In the previous version all pixels north of 4.57 degrees south were shifted consistently 9.3 km to the west. This version is correctly aligned at all points.\n\n\n\n\nMarthews, T. R., Dadson, S.

The resulting raster database consists of 21600 rows and 43200 columns, which are linked to harmonized soil property data. The use of a standardized structure allows for the linkage of the attribute data with the raster map to display or query the composition in terms of soil units and the characterization of selected soil parameters (organic Carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, cation exchange capacity of the soil and the clay fraction, total exchangeable nutrients, lime and gypsum contents, sodium exchange percentage, salinity, textural class and granulometry).\nData can be downloaded following the instructions of the instructions of the rhwsd R package usage or from the link below.\n\n\n\n\nFAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISSCAS/JRC, 2012.

The documentation of the map includes an explanation of the methodology, information per country, an assessment of the map quality, and references to the background and history of the irrigation mapping project.\nThe map shows the amount of area equipped for irrigation around the year 2005 in percentage of the total area on a raster with a resolution of 5 minutes. Additional map layers show the percentage of the area equipped for irrigation that was actually used for irrigation and the percentages of the area equipped for irrigation that was irrigated with groundwater, surface water or non-conventional sources of water. An explanation of the different terminology to indicate areas under irrigation is given in this glossary. Please note that information for the additional layers on area actually irrigated or on the water source for irrigation was derived from statistical survey data (e.g. census reports). Therefore all grid cells belonging to the same statistical unit will have the same value. Consequently, the accuracy at pixel level will be very limited, depending on the size of the statistical unit.\nFiles:\n\ngmia_v5_aei_pct.asc : Area equipped for irrigation expressed as percentage of total area (2.3 MB ASCII-grid, values have a precision of 6 decimals)\ngmia_v5_aai_pct_aei.asc : Area actually irrigated expressed as percentage of area equipped for irrigation (0.92 MB ASCII-grid, values have a precision of 6 decimals)\n\nProjection: Geographic\nNumber of columns: 4320\nNumber of rows: 2160\nNorth Bounding Coordinate: 90 degrees\nEast Bounding Coordinate: 180 degrees\nSouth Bounding Coordinate: -90 degrees\nWest Bounding Coordinate: -180 degrees\nCellsize: 5 minutes, 0.083333 decimal degrees\nNODATA values: Cells without irrigation are characterised by NODATA (-9), it does not mean that there was no data for these cells\n\n\n\n\nSiebert, S., Döll, P., Hoogeveen, J., Faures, J.-M., Frenken, K., Feick, S.

The GIS dataset was created using the soil map unit delineations of the broad scale Harmonised World Soil Database, version 1.21, with minor corrections, overlaid by a climate zones map (Köppen-Geiger) as co-variate, and soil property estimates derived from analyses of the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database for the respective mapped ‘soil/climate’ combinations.\nThe dataset considers 20 soil properties that are commonly required for global agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil gaseous emissions, and analyses of global environmental change. It presents ‘best’ estimates for: organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH(H2O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, total exchangeable bases (TEB), base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (content of sand, silt and clay), proportion of coarse fragments (less than 2 mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (-33 to -1500 kPa); also the dominant soil drainage class.Soil property estimates are presented for fixed depth intervals of 20 cm up to a depth of 100 cm, respectively of 50 cm between 100 cm to 200 cm (or less when appropriate) for so-called ‘synthetic’ profiles’ (as defined by their ‘soil/climate’ class). The respective soil property estimates were derived from statistical analyses of data for some 21,000 soil profiles managed in a working copy of the ISRIC-WISE database; this was done using an elaborate scheme of taxonomy-based transfer rules complemented with expert-rules that consider the ‘in-pedon’ consistency of the predictions. The type of rules used was flagged to provide an indication of the possible confidence (i.e. lineage) in the derived data.\nBest estimates for each attribute are given as means and standard deviations (STD), as calculated for the sample populations that remained upon application of a robust data outlier detection scheme. Results of the analyses can be linked to the spatial data through the unique map unit (grid cell) identifier, which is a combination of the soil unit and climate class code. Most map units are comprised of up to ten different components; each of these with their own range of derived soil properties and associated statistical uncertainties.\nEstimates of global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to 200 cm are presented in the technical documentation as an example of possible application.\n\n\n\n\nBatjes NH 2016.

GSDE provides soil information including soil particle-size distribution, organic carbon, and nutrients, etc. and quality control information in terms of confidence level. GSDE is based on the Soil Map of the World and various regional and national soil databases, including soil attribute data and soil maps. We used a standardized data structure and data processing procedures to harmonize the data collected from various sources. We then used a soil type linkage method (i.e. taxotransfer rules) and the polygon linkage method to derive the spatial distribution of soil properties. To aggregate the attributes of different compositions of a mapping unit, we used three mapping approaches: area-weighting method, the dominant soil type method and the dominant binned soil attribute method. In the released gridded dataset, we used the area-weighting method as it will meet the demands of most applications. The dataset can be also aggregate to a lower resolution. The resolution is 30 arc-seconds (about 1 km at the equator). The vertical variation of soil property was captured by eight layers to the depth of 2.3 m (i.e. 0- 0.045, 0.045- 0.091, 0.091- 0.166, 0.166- 0.289, 0.289- 0.493, 0.493- 0.829, 0.829- 1.383 and 1.383- 2.296 m).The documentation of the dataset can be downloaded in http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/download/doc/worldsoil/readme.zip\n\n\n\n\nShangguan, W., Dai, Y., Duan, Q., Liu, B. and Yuan, H., 2014.

SoilGrids prediction models are fitted using over 230 000 soil profile observations from the WoSIS database and a series of environmental covariates. Covariates were selected from a pool of over 400 environmental layers from Earth observation derived products and other environmental information including climate, land cover and terrain morphology. The outputs of SoilGrids are global soil property maps at six standard depth intervals (according to the GlobalSoilMap IUSS working group and its specifications) at a spatial resolution of 250 meters. Prediction uncertainty is quantified by the lower and upper limits of a 90% prediction interval. The additional uncertainty layer displayed at soilgrids.org is the ratio between the inter-quantile range and the median. The SoilGrids maps are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 License.\nMaps of the following soil properties are available: pH, soil organic carbon content, bulk density, coarse fragments content, sand content, silt content, clay content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen as well as soil organic carbon density and soil organic carbon stock.\n\n\n\n\nPoggio, L., de Sousa, L.

The use of these data is mostly aimed at:\n\naddressing outstanding scientific questions that arose as part of the IPCC reporting process;\nimproving the understanding of the climate system;\nproviding estimates of future climate change and related uncertainties;\nproviding input data for the adaptation to the climate change;\nexamining climate predictability and exploring the ability of models to predict climate on decadal time scales;\nevaluating how realistic the different models are in simulating the recent past.\n\nThe term “experiments” refers to the three main categories of CMIP6 simulations:\n\nHistorical experiments which cover the period where modern climate observations exist. These experiments show how the GCMs performs for the past climate and can be used as a reference period for comparison with scenario runs for the future. The period covered is typically 1850-2014.\nClimate projection experiments following the combined pathways of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). The SSP scenarios provide different pathways of the future climate forcing. The period covered is typically 2015-2100.\n\nThis catalogue entry provides both two- and three-dimensional data, along with an option to apply spatial and/or temporal subsetting to data requests. This is a new feature of the global climate projection dataset, which relies on compute processes run simultaneously in the ESGF nodes, where the data are originally located.\n\n\n\n\nCopernicus Climate Change Service, Climate Data Store, (2021): CMIP6 climate projections.

It is a joint project between UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and is managed by UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry.The WDPA is updated on a monthly basis, and can be downloaded using the button in the top right of the webpage.\n\n\n\n\nThe World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), [insert month/year of the version downloaded], Cambridge, UK: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN.\nhttps://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA\n\nGLEAM: Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset description\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of land evaporation (often referred to as ‘evapotranspiration’): transpiration, bare-soil evaporation, interception loss, open-water evaporation and sublimation. Additionally, GLEAM provides surface and root-zone soil moisture, potential evaporation and evaporative stress conditions.\n\n\n\n\nMartens, B., Miralles, D.G., Lievens, H., van der Schalie, R., de Jeu, R.A.M., Fernández-Prieto, D., Beck, H.E., Dorigo, W.A., and Verhoest, N.E.C.: GLEAM v3: satellite-based land evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, Geoscientific Model Development, 10, 1903–1925, doi: 10.5194/gmd-10-1903-2017, 2017\nMiralles, D.G., Holmes, T.R.H., de Jeu, R.A.M., Gash, J.H., Meesters, A.G.C.A., Dolman, A.J.: Global land-surface evaporation estimated from satellite-based observations, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 15, 453–469, doi: 10.5194/hess-15-453-2011, 2011\nhttps://www.gleam.eu/\n\nHydroBASINS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset description\n\n\n\n\n\nHydroBASINS represents a series of vectorized polygon layers that depict sub-basin boundaries at a global scale. The goal of this product is to provide a seamless global coverage of consistently sized and hierarchically nested sub-basins at different scales (from tens to millions of square kilometers), supported by a coding scheme that allows for analysis of catchment topology such as up- and downstream connectivity. HydroBASINS has been extracted from the gridded HydroSHEDS core layers at 15 arc-second resolution.\n\n\n\n\nLehner, B., Grill G. (2013).

Information about the RCPs and the scenario development process for the IPCC AR5 can be found in the IPCC Expert Meeting Report on New Scenarios and Moss et al. (2010).\nFor a draft work plan summarizing the data exchange between the Integrated Assessment and Climate Modeling community see also the “Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) Draft Handshake”. The final RCPs have been documented in a Special Issue of Climatic Change that was published in November 2011 (Climatic Change, Volume 109, Issue 1-2). The overview paper (van Vuuren et al, 2011) of the Special Issue summarizes the main achievements.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome"

    "text": "5.1 Adding citations in RStudio\nWhile you edit your report.Rmd file on RStudio, you can choose to work on the Source or Visual editors for RMarkdown files. The first allows to see the raw text/code, while the second already shows a rough preview of the rendered output from your markdown code.\nIt’s very easy to properly add citations from the Visual editor. You just need to click on Insert &gt; @ Citation to open the RStudio dialogue to create a citation.\n\n\n\nHow to add a citation to your report in RStudio.\n\n\nNext, click on From DOI and paste the DOI associated with the paper, book or dataset you want to cite. When you click Insert, a file references.bib is created in your R Project’s root directly. The references.bib file contains all the citations in your project, saved in BibTeX format. Every new citation that you create is added to the references.bib file with a tag that identifies it; here it’s @weedon2014.\n\n\n\nSearch DOI to create a citation and add the paper to your bibliography.\n\n\nYou can use these citation tags to add citations to your report. Writing @weedon2014 will produce the following inline citation Weedon et al. (2014) and writing [@weedon2014] will produce the in-parenthesis version (Weedon et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\nWeedon, Graham P., Gianpaolo Balsamo, Nicolas Bellouin, Sandra Gomes, Martin J.
